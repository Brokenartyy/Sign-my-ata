## 📖 About

**Sign My ATA** is a personal guestbook-style web project inspired by atabook.org,  
but built **from scratch** without using any existing templates.

This project is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and connected to a **cloud database (Firebase)**.

The main goal is simple:
- Full control over the ATA
- Freedom to update anytime
- No dependency on third-party templates

Reality check: control comes with pain.

## 🧩 Why I made this

I wanted:
- Custom UI
- Editable structure
- My own admin system
- No template limitations

Instead, I got:
- Authentication headaches
- Firestore rules nightmares
- API key incidents
- Bugs that spawn after deployment
- Errors that appear out of nowhere

*Fixing one issue often creates three new ones.  
Very on brand with the Olivia Rodrigo's song. (now playing url)*

## 🧠 Notes

This project exists because I refused to use a template  
and chose to suffer instead.

No regrets.  
(Okay, maybe a few.)
